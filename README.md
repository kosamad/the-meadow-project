Please note, The Meadow Project is a fictional company created to fulfill Project 4 as part of the Code Institute's course. All content has been created as if it were a real business fulfilling a real-life objective.

## Contents 

## Background 

Nature is a gateway to relaxation and tranquility. Studies show that exposure to nature can reduce stress, enhance mood, and improve overall well-being.  For those who can't escape into nature as often as they'd like, The Meadow Project aims to bring the outdoors in. Our goal is to infuse homes with locally grown, seasonal flowers together with oxygenating house plants, recreating the calming effects of nature indoors. 

Our commitment to sustainability is second to none. The Meadow Project transforms disused farmland into vibrant greenbelts that enrich wildlife. We prioritise eco-friendly deliveries using bicycles and zero-emission vans. By growing locally and seasonally, we ensure a low carbon footprint and deliver the freshest blooms. Visitors are welcome to enjoy our fields, participate in our events, and join our online community of like-minded individuals with access to engaging blog posts from the owners.

    *   Cost of postage.
    *   Delivery time scale.
    *   I'd want to be able to select a specific delivery date.

2. "From an online florist website are there any particular features you would like to see?"

    *   I'm not very good a exploring websites, so would like to see adverts or promts on the site saying workshops can be booked. I might not know they were there otherwise.
    *   I'd like to be able to give a colour preference to my bouquet.
    *   I'd like to be able to select plants based on position preferences (eg sunny spot or shade).
  
3. "Is there anything that would incentivise you to shop?"

    *   I'd be more likely to order from a local florist so emphasis on that.
    *   I like seeing reviews so I know how the flowers have lasted, if they were delivered in good condition etc. 
    *   Sometimes it's nice to give someone the option of chosing a bouqet themselves so I'd use a gift card option.

## User Experience Design

Applying User Experience (UX) design principles, I incorporated insights from stakeholder and user interviews to design the web app's features. This approach ensures the site is user-friendly, driving customer engagement while providing the necessary functionality for the business.

### Project Strategy

#### User Demographics

* The primary user of this site will be a Bristol-based resident seeking local delivery of ethically grown flowers and plants cultivated within their community, or individuals trying to find local workshops incorporating floristry techniques.

* A secondary user of the site will be someone wishing to visit the meadow through the meadow walk events. 

The overall emphasis of the site will be on local community engagement, simplicity, and ethical practices with a design that displays the beauty, and tranquiltiy of flowers/plants in the home or seen at the events in the meadow.

#### Constraints

The developer of this site is a junior, currently undergoing training in Python and Django while still perfecting industry standards for web design. Certain features may be beyond the developer's current skill set. Additionally, as the developer is working on the site part-time whilst balancing other responsibitlies, prioritisation of features is necessary to complete the project on time. Features not achieved in the initial phase will be rolled out in future deployments.

### Project Sructure

The structure of the site was designed by refering to the [User Stories](README.md#user-stories) and the opportunities outlined in the [Opportunity Matrix](README.md#opportunity-matrix).

This site map outlines the design of the website and which pages are accesible to which user. 

![Site Map](documentation/design/site-flow-chart.drawio.png)

This table outlines the design for the PostgreSQL database which will be used to store the data. It is a relational database that will be integrated with Django, enabling seamless database interactions. Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) will allow me to define database models in Python, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and dynamically generate HTML content within my application.

![Database Design](documentation/design/database-design.png)

The database will be integrated into The Meadow Project's Django framework under the following apps:

* Home: Manages the homepage content and main navigation.
* Products: Handles product listings and details.
* Events: Manages event listings and details.
* Basket: Manages the shopping cart functionality.
* Discounts: Manages the discount functionality.
* Checkout: Handles the checkout process and order completion.
* Blog: Manages blog posts and related content.
* Users: Handles user profiles and account settings.
* Reviews: Manages user reviews.

These apps will all reside under a centralised project called The Meadow Project.

### Project Skeleton

#### Wireframes

[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) was utilised to create detailed mockups of the project's pages.

I am showing an expanded display of the mobile and tablet designs to ensure thorough planning of content placement.

### Surface Design

#### Logo and Typography

I utilised [Canva](https://www.canva.com) to design my logo, aiming for a simple and clean image that evokes floral design, calmness, and beauty. I customised a template, focusing on colors that complement the site's imagery. The font was modified to use a freely available Google font, EB Garamond, which appears clean and stylish, conveying sophistication and professionalism to clients.

![Logo](documentation/design/full-logo.png)

![Font](documentation/design/ebgaramond-font.PNG)

This font will be paried with Lexend. This was selected after reading the article by google fonts titled ["Introducing accessibility in typography"](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/readability_and_accessibility/introducing_accessibility_in_typography). It states that Lexend was designed to be easier to read for all users, ensuring each character is distinctive from others.

### Colour Scheme

The site's color scheme was inspired by my logo design, incorporating the primary colors #FFBD59 (Hunyadi Yellow), #DC6874 (Bright Pink), #04724D (Dark Spring Green), and #E26016 (Spanish Orange). These colors will be used sparingly as accents to maintain a clean, sleek, and stylish design. The minimal use of color ensures that the product colors are prominently emphasised.
