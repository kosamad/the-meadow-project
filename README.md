Please note, The Meadow Project is a fictional company created to fulfill Project 4 as part of the Code Institute's course. All content has been created as if it were a real business fulfilling a real-life objective.

## Background 

Nature is a gateway to relaxation and tranquility. Studies show that exposure to nature can reduce stress, enhance mood, and improve overall well-being.  For those who can't escape into nature as often as they'd like, The Meadow Project aims to bring the outdoors in. Our goal is to infuse homes with locally grown, seasonal flowers together with oxygenating house plants, recreating the calming effects of nature indoors. 

Our commitment to sustainability is second to none. The Meadow Project transforms disused farmland into vibrant greenbelts that enrich wildlife. We prioritise eco-friendly deliveries using bicycles and zero-emission vans. By growing locally and seasonally, we ensure a low carbon footprint and deliver the freshest blooms. Visitors are welcome to enjoy our fields, participate in our events, and join our online community of like-minded individuals with access to engaging blog posts from the owners.

    *   Cost of postage.
    *   Delivery time scale.
    *   I'd want to be able to select a specific delivery date.

2. "From an online florist website are there any particular features you would like to see?"

    *   I'm not very good a exploring websites, so would like to see adverts or promts on the site saying workshops can be booked. I might not know they were there otherwise.
    *   I'd like to be able to give a colour preference to my bouquet.
    *   I'd like to be able to select plants based on position preferences (eg sunny spot or shade).
  
3. "Is there anything that would incentivise you to shop?"

    *   I'd be more likely to order from a local florist so emphasis on that.
    *   I like seeing reviews so I know how the flowers have lasted, if they were delivered in good condition etc. 
    *   Sometimes it's nice to give someone the option of chosing a bouqet themselves so I'd use a gift card option.

## User Experience Design

Applying User Experience (UX) design principles, I incorporated insights from stakeholder and user interviews to design the web app's features. This approach ensures the site is user-friendly, driving customer engagement while providing the necessary functionality for the business.

### Project Strategy

#### User Demographics

* The primary user of this site will be a Bristol-based resident seeking local delivery of ethically grown flowers and plants cultivated within their community, or individuals trying to find local workshops incorporating floristry techniques.

* A secondary user of the site will be someone wishing to visit the meadow through the meadow walk events. 

The overall emphasis of the site will be on local community engagement, simplicity, and ethical practices with a design that displays the beauty, and tranquiltiy of flowers/plants in the home or seen at the events in the meadow.

#### Constraints

The developer of this site is a junior, currently undergoing training in Python and Django while still perfecting industry standards for web design. Certain features may be beyond the developer's current skill set. Additionally, as the developer is working on the site part-time, prioritisation of features is necessary to complete the project on time. Features not achieved in the initial phase will be rolled out in future deployments.
